# Data-Cleaning-Fixing
Hy, this repository consist my job when I still worked in Torche Education Company. Feel free to give me a feedback :)

In the process of data analysis, one of the crucial steps is data cleaning and fixing. Using the powerful Python library, Pandas, I successfully handled the data cleaning tasks for Torche Data Company. Due to the sensitivity of the information, I am unable to provide the original dataset, but I can highlight the steps involved in cleaning and fixing the data.

Firstly, I conducted a thorough examination of the dataset to identify any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers. Using Pandas' functionalities, I implemented techniques such as data imputation, where missing values were filled in with appropriate values based on the context of the data. Additionally, I handled outliers by either removing them or applying appropriate transformations to ensure data integrity.

Furthermore, I performed data validation to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the dataset. This involved checking for duplicate entries, inconsistencies in data formats, and validating against predefined rules. By applying data manipulation techniques in Pandas, I was able to clean and standardize the data, ensuring its reliability for further analysis.

Throughout the process, I maintained data integrity and privacy by adhering to strict data protection protocols. The cleaned and fixed dataset served as a solid foundation for subsequent data analysis and modeling, enabling meaningful insights and informed decision-making for Torche Data Company.
